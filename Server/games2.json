        "detailed_description": "Excavator Simulator VR is a short showcase of what it feels like to operate a giant 90 tonne excavator in either ISO or SAE control patterns. This includes real-time digging, boom/bucket movement, and tank-like movement. Explore levels to climb up hills or dig a mega hole to the ocean. There are no limits even if you prefer not to complete the levels. Ever wondered what the difference between heavy machinery controls is or want to improve your excavation skills while in the office? After a few hours of gameplay you will be the best virtual operator there is. You will be able to control an excavator in either ISO and SAE control patterns without hesitation. Want to dig a hole or go swimming in your excavator? There is nothing stopping you from doing anything. Go dig that swimming pool of your dreams or pile up a mountain of dirt. No extra hardware is required. If you have a VR headset compatible with SteamVR, then you have a virtual cab and can interact with joysticks and levers using your virtual work gloves. You do not even need to have audio speakers as there is no audio currently in the game. It is suggested to sit in a chair while playing this game to reduce potential for motion sickness. Similar guidelines as racing VR games. *Note that this game is mostly intended for showcase and education purposes so it only contains three tutorial levels all of which are open world (meaning you are not limited by the tutorial itself). **This game is not a substitute for proper excavation training and is only intended as an introductory course on the basics of excavator controls. Virtual training may aid in actual excavator operation. ",

It is up to you to run through the corridors before the doors shut or if you don't want to risk it then simply solve the maths type problems to enable the hallway to open up in turn for you to get back to your space ship safely. but this will come at a cost as the space station starts to float away from the disaster that has struck and it is your task to retrieve and maintain the station whilst restoring it back to a functioning condition.

        "detailed_description": "It’s time to discover your inner artist! With Vermillion, you get a fully equipped oil painting studio in your home, without any of the mess. Ready for the unrivaled sense of accomplishment from creating your first painting? Learn with your favorite YouTube artists using the built-in web browser, trace reference images directly on the canvas, or even better - learn to paint from (new) friends in multiplayer! Up to four people can paint together in the studio. Share palettes, work together on each other's canvas, teach a class, or have an old-fashioned paint night. Vermillion features realistic wet-on-wet color mixing, undo, layers, and a wide range of simulated brushes. Developed with the feedback of both traditional and digital artists, you're sure to get the fun of oil painting without any of the frustration. Once done, easily share your masterpiece as an image. Or, create a beautifully varnished 3D model export for your VR home. FEATURES: Multiplayer Paint together with up to three of your friends, or new friends you meet in public rooms. Cross platform with Quest 2. Analogue color mixing Vermillion allows you to blend colors as you would with real paints. Dip your brush into multiple colors, and mix a new color by whisking the brush on the palette - and yes, yellow and blue make green! Integrated web browser with canvas projector Never painted before? No problem! The easel has a web browser right next to it, allowing you to paint along with your favorite artists on YouTube for the first time without needing physical equipment, and giving you convenient access to the internet's vast library of learning resources and reference material. Vermillion comes with an hour long in-game paint-along teaching you how to paint a cute robin - you'll hardly believe what you are capable of! The browser can even be projected onto the canvas, so you can easily trace your reference. You can also display local images on the browser. Designed for wet-on-wet painting Vermillion is made for wet-on-wet painting. It mixes color not only on the palette, but also on the canvas, allowing you to create perfectly smooth gradients with just a few strokes. Use a dry brush to blend colors further, or to move paint around to create a variety of effects from reflections to grass. Layers While Vermillion is made to be the ultimate wet-on-wet experience, sometimes you just need to paint on another layer for detail work. Which is why it's fortunate that there is currently support for four separate layers! Fine control over every mark Exert fine-grained control over your brushwork through the pressure with which you press the brush into the surface. Use the hand steadying tool to compensate for the lack of a physical canvas to rest your hand against. Distinct brushes From the two inch brush all the way down to the rigger, there's a brush for every occasion. Sharable You can export your finished painting as a 3D model to use in your VR home, share through Sketchfab, or use in social VR applications. Vermillion also offers up to 8k image export of your finished piece, which can be used for canvas prints! Made for streamers With a controllable spectator camera to offer great views of the process while streaming or recording, as well as full LIV support, you'll be sure to create amazing content. Paintings in the trailer and screenshots by David Kühnel, Chad Munn, Gladski, and Markus Franz. ",

        "detailed_description": "SpaceEngine is a 1:1 scale science-based Universe simulator, featuring billions upon billions of galaxies, nebulae, stars, and planets, all shown at their full real-world scale. Explore Earth and our neighboring worlds in the Solar System, orbit a black hole in a galaxy billions of light-years away, or visit anything in between seamlessly, with no transitions. All of time and space are yours to explore – cruise between the stars at a million times the speed of light, and accelerate time to watch the orbital motions of a thousand worlds play out before your eyes. Every planet you encounter in your journey will feature procedural 3D terrain with detailed textures. Everything you see in the sky – stars and galaxies, planets and moons, asteroids and comets, black holes and neutron stars, star clusters and nebulae – are yours to explore at the press of a button. Spacecraft with Newtonian physics and pilot-assist autopilot features (in early development but fully usable) are yours to fly anywhere in the universe in the Flight Simulator mode. SpaceEngine is also very friendly for creators of mods and add-ons – create your own planets, star systems, even galaxies, import your own spacecraft models, create custom GUI skins, and more, all easily sharable with others. With SpaceEngine, the possibilities are limitless. SpaceEngine Planetarium capabilities: Astronomy All types of celestial objects are represented: galaxies, nebulae, stars and star clusters, planets and moons, comets and asteroids. Known celestial objects are represented using data from catalogs: galaxies (NGC/IC), stars (HIPPARCOS), star clusters, nebulae, and planets (Solar System and known extrasolar planets). Regions of space not yet cataloged feature procedurally generated objects: galaxies, stars, star clusters, nebulae, and planetary systems. Controls You are free to move around the universe – travel seamlessly between any object and any distance, from surface to orbit to interstellar and intergalactic space. Moving through space is as easy as 'click and go', as well as game-style free flight using the WASD keys or a gamepad. Also, time travel is possible: you can accelerate, decelerate, or reverse the flow of time, and jump to a specified date. Detailed interactive tutorials will familiarize you with the controls. Graphics Volumetric 3D models of galaxies and nebulae with interstellar dust clouds, and 3D landscapes on planets and stars. For many Solar System bodies, actual data from space probes is used, with huge, high-resolution texture packs available as free DLC. For unmapped and procedural planets, the surface is generated procedurally using your computer's GPU. Other features include realistic atmospheric scattering, eclipse shadows, animated auroras and comet tails, and physically-based light warping near black holes and neutron stars, with animated accretion disks and jets. Physics Realistic and physically-based generation of procedural objects (galaxies, star systems, planets) and their physical properties (mass, radius, temperature, atmospheric parameters, etc). The orbital motion of planets, moons, and stars in multiple-star systems are accurately calculated and displayed. Realistic space ship design concepts and physics: orbital motion, atmospheric flight model, and Alcubierre warp drive physics. Virtual reality SpaceEngine supports Oculus (via native library) and SteamVR (HTC Vive, Valve Index, WMR and other headsets). Support of VR controllers is partial: you can select objects with one controller and move around with the other one. Please note that VR support is still a work in progress, and new users should become familiar with the program in 2D before trying to use VR. Sound Original background music tracks made by many authors, with context-sensitive playback. Sound effects for planetary environments and space ships are in development. Tools Built-in tutorials will help you start using the Planetarium. Search for celestial objects by name and search for the nearest star systems. Browse the cosmos using a scalable Universe map and planetary system chart. Saving, exporting, and importing of locations is supported, which can easily be shared between users. The program keeps an automatic journal of objects you have recently visited. Learn every detail about the objects you find using the built-in “Wiki” info system, with additional hand-written descriptions of many known objects. Display the orbital paths of celestial objects, labels and markers, constellations, and other informational tools. Multi-language support Currently SpaceEngine is available in English, German, French, Italian, Spanish, Dutch, Finnish, Swedish, Croatian, Czech, Polish, Ukrainian, Russian, Catalan, Chinese, Japanese, Korean languages. Many new localizations are under development. Only localizations which are 100% complete are displayed on the Steam store page, but you can enable others in-game. Modding SpaceEngine supports creating and importing user add-ons: catalogs, models and textures for deep space objects, planets, and space ships. Spacecraft models, representing both real and fictional designs – including from popular sci-fi franchises – are commonly imported and shared by the community on the Steam Workshop. ",

With funding from a mysterious investor, Dr. Lynch and his PhD Candidate Jean Robinson have set out aboard a research vessel to dive the wreck of Titanic and answer questions that have remained submerged for a century. This game allows you to explore the shipwreck inside and out and recover items and complete missions such as recovery of a downed ROV, Documentary Film Making and the creation of a photomosaic. In the 1912 experience, players will witness key events through the eyes of a survivor onboard lifeboat 6. It is an historically accurate recreation of events, based on eye-witness testimony and substantial research. Players will leave with a deeper understanding of this historic and tragic event.

GLORIA Quinn, Assistant Program Manager, Bethany Ranch Home” Bethany Ranch Home “Jam Studio VR has been phenomenal as an incentive and a motivator to get our students to do things that they’re often uncomfortable or unwilling to do, to use as a motivator to get them through the week,and to simply come to school each day so that they’re eligible to participate in the program. Having this at the end of our week is a really juicy carrot that encourages our students to push through and really grow and develop because they love it. This is a highly motivating, engaging activity for them. For our students who often have fine and gross motor challenges, spatial awareness challenges, significant sensory challenges, and impulsivity challenges – this VR App and the process of having them wait in line brings their vestibular and other senses into play in order to engage and has been outstanding. It’s a highly discreet way to address all of those deficits for them in a way that they’re working harder than they probably would just to have the opportunity to do that. Matt Drowne, Head of Gateway Academy” Gateway Academy ““As a neurologist and research scientist, I support that the possibilities within the Beamz technology are limitless for individuals of all ages. From children with developmental disabilities to those facing serious life-threatening illnesses, Beamz makes perfect sense. For children and adults in rehabilitation, Beamz has extraordinary potential to facilitate and accelerate ongoing progress. In the context of senior care, Beamz can help older people discover renewed confidence, meaning and value through the joy of recreational music making.” -Barry Bittman, MD – President &amp; CEO” Yamaha Music and Wellness Institute ",

About the Software The Mars Society, the world's largest nonprofit organization dedicated to the human exploration of Mars, operates the Mars Virtual Reality (MarsVR) program to create engineering-grade virtual reality simulations of future human Mars exploration. The MarsVR team has been working since 2018 on a digital twin of the real-life Mars Desert Research Station (MDRS) facility located in southern Utah. As the world’s largest and longest-running analog facility, MDRS has been in operation since 2001, with 235 crews and over 1,500 individual crew members having stayed at the MDRS during the two decades since its establishment. MarsVR is a full-fidelity simulation of the MDRS (Mars Desert Research Station) campus, including the station’s exterior and interior spaces. In the real world, only researchers and astronauts-in-training are able to visit the MDRS, and the wait list can be over a year. Consequently, the Mars Society has built this first Steam release to allow everyone the chance to tour the MDRS and better understand analog science, technology, and procedures. While this version is a pre-release taster focused mainly on the environment and building exteriors, the final version (expected to be released within a few months) will include the ability to explore the interior spaces, and conduct optional training scenarios where crew members learn to conduct a Mars analog simulation in real life. Our end goal is to give everyone a taste of what it will take to visit, build a habitat, and thrive on Mars.",

After rigorous textual research, the 'Xiaoxiang Pavilion' described in 'A Dream of Red Mansions' is restored in a panoramic view, recreating classical gardens, furniture and daily scenes in the Ming Dynasty. You can pick up everything you like and play with it. You might even fabricate a Chinese 'paper kite', hand-write a pair of Chinese characters, and listen to the Chinese zither played by the ancients on the waterfront. It is like you travel through time and space, and witness the ancients’ elegance and panache. Finally, you walk in the wind, appreciate the transcendent Chinese natural scenery, and arrive at the next node of exploration.

It is a fast developing technology which can serve as an excellent tool also when it comes to addressing important social issues. It is specifically with this aspect of VR in mind that we are developing the innovative application Chernobyl VR Project. It is the very first virtual tour around the Chernobyl and Pripyat area, compatible with multiple VR headsets. We decided that this should not be a simply commercial project. We aimed to reach the people, for whom the disaster had an intimate, private, and sometimes family aspect to it. We met lots of people who had been near Chernobyl when the disaster happened, including the so called liquidators, who helped clean up the disaster site, often at the price of acute radiation sickness. We also managed to reach very famous people willing to support our project, among others the Nobel Prize winner Svetlana Alexievich (author of Chernobyl Prayer) and the legendary boxer Vitali Klitschko, now Mayor of Kiev). However, the most important decision is the declaration of donating part of the proceeds from the sales of the Chernobyl VR Project to foundations helping the victims of the disaster. In association with the Polish-Ukrainian Open Dialog Foundation, we will select organizations to provide support to. In doing so, we hope that we contribute to helping the victims, and that the initiative will give our project another educational and social dimension. Chernobyl VR Project began with the simple plan of bringing people into the Exclusion Zone, but over time it has grown into something much more personal as we find new stories to be told and places to be explored. This is not the end of Chernobyl VR Project. Plans are already in place to visit the area again to collect even more footage and bring more of the area's history to life later this year.",

        "detailed_description": "VR Robotics Simulator is an engineering tool used for industrial robot simulation, design, layout, rapid prototyping and reach analysis built exclusively for the HTC Vive. With VR Robotics Simulator, you can build a robotic cell and program your robot within minutes. You can conduct reach studies to select the correct size and type of robot arm, choose the best positioning equipment for your application and use it as a Guided Sales tool to help customers visualize solutions. Using VR Robotics Simulator you can: - Browse a large selection of pre-configured robotic work cells from the Selection Halls. This will allow you to examine these different work cells in detail and develop an appreciation for their relative size and capabilities. - Includes a variety of 6 axis manipulators and delta robots. - Cells include a variety of single and multi-axis positioners such as headstocks, tilt/rotate, skyhook, drop center, H frames, ferris wheels, floor/ceiling tracks, and multi-axis gantries. - Build a cell from the ground up in real time. Save your creations for later use. - Experiment with several different tooling options such as arc welding, spot welding and vacuum/magnetic/claw grippers. - Learn about robotics and how to operate VRRS from the Training Room. This will cover basic robotics concepts, how to operate the various arms and positioners in VRRS, and how to construct your own robot cells. - Import a variety of model formats for viewing in VR. Supported formats: - OBJ (with MTL file) - 3DS - FBX - STL - DXF - DAE (Collada) - X3D - Blend - GLTF - PLY - 3MF VR Robot Simulator CANNOT export programs that can be used on vendor-specific controllers such as Fanuc, ABB, Motoman, UR, etc. You CAN export points out as XML relative to the robot base. This program is intended to be a low-cost entry point to demonstrate the potential for robot cell design in VR. If you want to do virtual programming for a specific robot arm and export the program to the controller you will need to contact the vendor and purchase the appropriate offline programming software. Immerse yourself in the world of industrial robots and interact with your creations in Virtual Reality!",
